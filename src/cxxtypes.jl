# # # Representing C++ values
#
# Since we can't always keep C++ values in C++ land and to make C++ values
# convenient to work with, we need to come up with a way to represent them in
# Julia. In particular, we would like to be able to represent both C++ types
# has well as having a way to represent runtime instances of C++ values.
#
# One way to do this would be to have a

# where ClangType is simply a pointer to Clang's in memory representation. This
# has the advantage that working with this type does not introduce a separate
# name lookup whenever it is used. However, it also has the disadvantage that
# it is not stable across serialization and not very meaningful.
#
# Instead, what we do here is build up a hierarchy of Julia types that represent
# the C++ type hierarchy. This has the advantage that clang does not necessarily
# need to be in memory to work with these object, as well as allowing these
# types to be stable across serialization. However, it comes with the
# it comes with the disadvantage of having to perform a name lookup to get
# the clang::Type* pointer back.
#
# In the future, we may want to have a cache that maps types to clang types,
# or go with a different model entirely, but that decision should be based
# on experience how these behave in practice.
#
# # A note on CVR qualifiers
#
# Though I had hoped to avoid it, correctly representing template parameters
# requires tracking CVR (const, volatile, restrict) qualifiers on types. The way
# this is currently implemented is as an extra CVR type parameter on
# applicable julia types. This type parameter should be a tuple of Bools
# indicating whether the qualifier is present in CVR order.
